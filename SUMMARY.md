- **Intended Proxy Ports**: 8888 (direct/Tailscale), 8889 (Tor routing)
- **Survey Port**: 8090

### Current Functional VPN Setup

#### Using Tor Directly as VPN
The system currently provides VPN functionality through the Tor SOCKS5 proxy accessible via Tailscale:

**For all accounts:**
- Host: 100.100.74.9 (Tailscale IP)
- Port: 9050
- Type: SOCKS5

**To verify:**
```bash
curl --socks5-hostname 100.100.74.9:9050 https://ipapi.co/json/
```

### Browser Configuration for Windows

#### For Account 1: arsen.k111999@gmail.com (Tailscale routing)
**Firefox:**
1. Open Firefox
2. Go to Settings → Network Settings → Settings
3. Select "Manual proxy configuration"
4. SOCKS Host: 100.100.74.9, Port: 9050
5. Check "Proxy DNS when using SOCKS v5"
6. Select SOCKS v5
7. Click OK

**Chrome (with separate profile):**
```bash
chrome.exe --proxy-server="socks5://100.100.74.9:9050" --host-resolver-rules="MAP * 0.0.0.0 , EXCLUDE myproxy"
```

#### For Account 2: lekov00@gmail.com (Tor routing)
**Firefox:**
1. Create a separate Firefox profile for this account
2. Open Firefox with Profile Manager: `firefox.exe -P`
3. Select or create new profile for lekov00@gmail.com
4. Configure same SOCKS5 settings:
   - SOCKS Host: 100.100.74.9, Port: 9050
   - Check "Proxy DNS when using SOCKS v5"
   - Select SOCKS v5

**Chrome (with separate profile):**
```bash
chrome.exe --user-data-dir="C:\Users\%USERNAME%\ChromeProfiles\lekov00" --proxy-server="socks5://100.100.74.9:9050"
```

### Simultaneous Usage
Both accounts can be used simultaneously by:
1. Using different browser profiles/instances
2. Each configured with the same SOCKS5 proxy (100.100.74.9:9050)
3. Logging into different accounts in each browser instance

### Known Issues
1. **Port Conflicts**: Services on ports 8888/8889 fail to start due to "address already in use" error
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Survey automation requires playwright module
3. **Configuration Issue**: Proxy configuration file structure seems to conflict with current setup

### Troubleshooting Steps Performed
1. Cleaned up old processes and PID files
2. Verified Tor operation and Swiss exit nodes
3. Identified port conflict issues
4. Confirmed working SOCKS5 proxy functionality via Tailscale

### Next Steps for Full Functionality
1. Fix port conflicts in smart_proxy_v2.py
2. Install playwright or replace survey automation with alternative
3. Verify config.json structure for proxy routing
4. Test multi-account proxy routing capability

### Current Working State
- ✅ VPN functionality via Tor SOCKS5 proxy accessible through Tailscale
- ✅ Swiss IP routing confirmed 
- ✅ Stable Tor service operation
- ⚠️ Advanced proxy features not operational
- ⚠️ Survey automation not operational

The core VPN functionality is available using Tor directly at 100.100.74.9:9050 with Swiss routing accessible from any device connected to the same Tailscale network.
