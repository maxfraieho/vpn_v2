BUILD MODE — prepare for real testing on the Swiss Termux host (Tailscale IP = 100.100.74.9)

You have already implemented Tasks 1–6. Now we need a “testing & hardening pass” so we can run this on the real Swiss tablet and verify A/B workspaces.

Constraints:
- Termux on Android (no Docker, no systemd).
- Access via Tailscale only.
- VNC must bind to localhost (127.0.0.1) and require VncAuth (password).
- noVNC/websockify must be reachable on the tablet Tailscale IP (100.100.74.9) for ports 6080/6081.
- No anti-detection/fingerprint spoofing features.

TASK A — Add a dedicated TEST RUNBOOK + expected outputs
1) Create `gateway/novnc-termux/TESTING.md` with:
   - Exact commands to run on the Swiss tablet
   - Expected outputs for each step (examples)
   - Verification URLs:
     Workspace A: http://100.100.74.9:6080/vnc.html
     Workspace B: http://100.100.74.9:6081/vnc.html
   - Isolation test: A and B must NOT share cookies (separate chromium user-data-dir)

Include these checks:
- `tailscale status` / `tailscale ip -4`
- `ss -ltnp | grep -E '5901|5902|6080|6081'`
- `curl -I http://127.0.0.1:6080/vnc.html` (on tablet)
- `curl -I http://100.100.74.9:6080/vnc.html` (from another tailnet device)

TASK B — Make bind behavior safe by default
2) Ensure VNC always binds to localhost:
   - Start VNC with `-localhost` and confirm ports 5901/5902 listen only on 127.0.0.1
3) Ensure websockify binds to Tailscale IP by default (not 0.0.0.0):
   - If `.env` doesn’t set `WEBSOCKIFY_BIND`, detect the tablet tailscale IPv4 and bind to it
   - Fallback: 0.0.0.0 only if explicitly configured

TASK C — Add a single “smoke test” command
4) Add `gateway/novnc-termux/scripts/smoke_test.sh` that:
   - runs healthcheck for all workspaces
   - verifies vnc ports are localhost-only
   - verifies novnc endpoints respond with HTTP 200/302
   - exits non-zero if any check fails

TASK D — Improve Cloudy automation for testing
5) Update Cloudy tasks so we can run:
   - deploy_task.yaml → install + start all + smoke_test
   - health_task.yaml → healthcheck + smoke_test summary

TASK E — Report back clearly
After you implement A–D, respond with:
1) File list changed/created
2) The exact step-by-step commands we should run on the Swiss tablet to test
3) The expected success criteria (“Done when”)

Start now by implementing TASK A (TESTING.md) and TASK B (safe default binds), then commit.
