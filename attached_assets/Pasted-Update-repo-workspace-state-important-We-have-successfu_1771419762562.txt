Update: repo + workspace state (important)

We have successfully connected this Replit workspace to the GitHub repo:
https://github.com/maxfraieho/vpn_v2.git

What we did (repo manipulation summary):
1) The Replit project initially was a clean fullstack JS template, not our repo.
2) We removed the template git history and replaced the workspace contents with vpn_v2 from GitHub.
3) We cleaned leftover template files using `git clean -fd` so the workspace is now a clean working copy of vpn_v2.
4) Current git state: branch `master`, up to date with `origin/master`, working tree clean.
5) We removed template artifacts (client/server/package.json/etc). This repo is now the PRIMARY codebase for the project.

Why:
We do NOT want to mix projects. We will fully evolve the existing vpn_v2 repo into SwissWorkspaceGateway.

What we added (scaffold/stubs):
We created a new scaffold to start SwissWorkspaceGateway development without Docker:

- gateway/novnc-termux/
  - scripts/
    - install_termux.sh (stub)
    - start_workspace.sh (stub)
    - stop_workspace.sh (stub)
    - healthcheck.sh (stub)
  - https-wrapper/ (placeholder for optional Node.js HTTPS/auth wrapper)
  - README.md (stub)

- gateway/automation/cloudy/
  - deploy_task.yaml (stub)
  - restart_task.yaml (stub)
  - health_task.yaml (stub)

- docs/SECURITY.md (stub)

We also added a minimal `.replit` to prevent “Run” failures (placeholder run command).

Context constraints (must drive architecture):
- Swiss host is a Samsung Android tablet running Termux (NOT Linux VPS).
- No Docker, no systemd.
- We can run: Node.js, Python, Bash in Termux.
- Tailscale is available.
- Cloudy CLI is installed on the Swiss Termux host and can execute scripts; we want to automate deploy/start/health/restart tasks through Cloudy + Claude agent.
- Primary goal: legitimate remote workspace access (noVNC-like) to a desktop/browser session running on the Swiss host.
- No anti-fraud / geo-circumvention / “anti-detect” features.

What we need from you now:
1) Confirm you see the repo files (manager_v2.sh, swiss_proxy_stream.py, swiss_socks5_proxy.py, TERMUX_README.md, etc.) and the new gateway/ scaffolding.
2) Propose a clear, Termux-realistic architecture for SwissWorkspaceGateway:
   - Choose the most feasible display/session approach on Android+Termux (e.g., Termux:X11 + lightweight WM + browser) and how VNC/noVNC fits.
   - Define the runtime components and ports.
   - Define how access is restricted (prefer Tailscale-only).
   - Define what the Node https-wrapper is for (optional) and when we need it.
3) Decide (after reviewing existing vpn_v2 code) whether SOCKS5 should play any role:
   - keep separate,
   - diagnostics only,
   - or optional transport/fallback.
   Do not assume; justify.
4) Provide a concrete implementation plan with milestones:
   - Phase 1 (MVP): get a working noVNC session from the Swiss Termux host, accessible over Tailscale.
   - Phase 2 (hardening): auth, logs, rate-limits, safer defaults, clearer docs.
   - Phase 3 (automation): Cloudy tasks that run idempotent scripts and report health.
5) Most importantly: tell us exactly what you will implement next (specific files you will edit/create) and in what order, and why.

Please respond with:
- A text-based architecture diagram
- Final folder structure (if you want to adjust the scaffold)
- A prioritized TODO list (next 10–20 actions)
- Any assumptions you need (clearly labeled)
