We have a real-host stability blocker on Termux(Android)+proot Debian for SwissWorkspaceGateway.

Observed symptoms (from logs):
- Xtigervnc starts for :2 on 127.0.0.1:5902, but the port disappears shortly after.
- TigerVNC session log shows Openbox + Chromium-related errors:
  - dbus/bus.cc: cannot connect to /run/dbus/system_bus_socket (missing)
  - dbus: “Could not parse server address: Unknown address type”
  - netlink socket permission denied
  - udev monitor init failed
  - (sometimes) “handler exception: [Errno 38] Function not implemented”
- This correlates strongly with auto-starting Chromium inside xstartup. In proot on Android, Chromium + dbus/udev/netlink often destabilizes the VNC session.

Goal:
Make both workspaces A and B reliably stay UP with minimal GUI (Openbox + xterm) and no auto-launched browser.
Browser launch must be optional and user-driven (manual from xterm or separate helper), not part of xstartup.

Required changes:
1) STOP auto-launching Chromium/Firefox in xstartup (both workspace_a/xstartup and workspace_b/xstartup).
   xstartup must be minimal:
     - unset SESSION_MANAGER, unset DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
     - openbox &
     - xterm &
     - wait
   No browser, no xfce, no dbus-launch.

2) Add a new helper script:
   gateway/novnc-termux/scripts/launch_browser.sh <workspace_id> <firefox|chromium> [url]
   - It should run inside Debian with correct HOME pointing to the workspace base_dir.
   - Prefer Firefox by default (more stable in proot).
   - If chromium is requested, use “proot-friendly” flags:
       --no-sandbox
       --disable-dev-shm-usage
       --disable-gpu
       --disable-features=UseOzonePlatform
     and DO NOT fail the whole workspace if chromium exits.

3) Add config flags in .env.example:
   START_BROWSER=0 (default)
   BROWSER=firefox (default)
   START_URL=about:blank
   Rationale: stability-first; user can opt-in.

4) Improve start_workspace.sh:
   - Treat dbus/udev/netlink errors as WARN only.
   - Start VNC and websockify regardless; do not rely on any GUI app to be healthy.
   - Add “crash attribution” logging:
       After VNC port becomes available, do NOT attempt to infer success from logs containing Chromium/dbus errors.
       If port disappears within N seconds, print:
         - last 80 lines of the workspace’s TigerVNC log ($base_dir/.config/tigervnc/*:${display}.log)
         - the xstartup content used
         - whether START_BROWSER was enabled
     This will make regressions obvious.

5) Fix healthcheck correctness:
   Current healthcheck sometimes reports “not running” even right after start. Ensure checks are done consistently:
   - Use run_in_debian + “export HOME=$base_dir” for per-workspace VNC checks (nc -z 127.0.0.1 $vnc_port).
   - websockify checks should remain host-side (PID + port 608x).
   - noVNC HTTP check should be against WEBSOCKIFY_BIND:$novnc_port.

6) Acceptance criteria (real host):
   - bash scripts/stop_workspace.sh all; bash scripts/start_workspace.sh all
   - Both VNC ports respond inside Debian:
       proot-distro login debian -- bash -lc 'export HOME=.../ws_a; nc -z 127.0.0.1 5901'
       proot-distro login debian -- bash -lc 'export HOME=.../ws_b; nc -z 127.0.0.1 5902'
   - Both noVNC endpoints return HTTP 200:
       curl http://100.100.74.9:6080/vnc.html
       curl http://100.100.74.9:6081/vnc.html
   - healthcheck.sh all exits 0
   - Browser is NOT launched unless launch_browser.sh is executed (or START_BROWSER=1 explicitly).

Please implement as a PR with a short changelog. Focus on stability under proot Debian on Android (no systemd, no Docker).
