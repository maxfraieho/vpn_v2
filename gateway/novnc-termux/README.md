# SwissWorkspaceGateway (Termux / noVNC)

This module is intended to run on a Swiss Android tablet using Termux.
No Docker. No systemd.

Goal: provide web-based remote workspace access (noVNC-style) to a desktop/browser session
running on the Swiss host, preferably restricted to Tailscale only.

Status: scaffold.
